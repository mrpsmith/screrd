    # Overview

    The Ship.Cars Rate Engine API makes it easy for external systems to access the Ship.Cars predictive calculator.

    Using the Rate Engine API, you can submit car load details and get a predicted quote almost instantly. You can also retrieve the details of an existing quote or look up the Year-Make-Model vehicle data that is available in the database.

    ## Resource URLs

    The base URL for accessing the Rate Engine API is:

    ```http
    http://rateengine.ship.cars/
    ```

    In API calls, the base URL needs to be followed by the version number of the API (currently at version 1), the path to the specific resource, and your [API key](#section/Authentication). As a result, you can access specific resources with an HTTP request to:

    ```http
    http://rateengine.ship.cars/<version>/path/to/resource?token=<api-key>
    ```

    ## HTTP Methods

    The Rate Engine API supports two HTTP methods, `GET` and `POST`.

     *  a `GET` request retrieves an identified quote resource or an array of YMM resources.
     *  a `POST` request creates a new quote resource.

    ## Data Format

    The Rate Engine API uses the JSON data format for requests and responses.

    In `POST` requests, you need to include an HTTP header that specifies the request body type is JSON:

    ```
    Content-Type: application/json
    ```

    For all other requests, the HTTP header that specifies the accepted response type is optional.

    ## Dates and Times

    All dates and times use the ISO 8601 profile that is defined by W3C in the *[Date and Time Formats](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime)* document.

    If you don't specify a timezone offset for datetimes in your requests, the assumed offset from UTC is the one of the US Central time zone (CST or CDT).

    # Authentication

    The Rate Engine API requires an API key to authenticate requests. You need to send a valid API key in the `token` query parameter.

    <!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->

    To sign up for an account and receive an API key, contact us at [integration@ship.cars](mailto:integration@ship.cars).

    ## Rate Limits

    Access to the Rate Engine API is rate limitted per API key and you can make up to X requests per Y to API resources.

    # Error Handling

    The Rate Engine API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of API calls.

    In case of success, the API responds with a 2xx status code and returns the created or requested resource in the response body.

    In case of failure, the API responds with a 4xx or a 5xx status code and returns details about the error in the response body.

    The following table describes the most common status codes returned by the Rate Engine API with details about the most likely cause for errors.

    | Status Code | Description | Most Likely Cause   |
    |----------|--------------------|--------------------|
    | 2xx      | Success            |                    |
    | 404      | Resource not found | The identified quote resource doesn't exist.
    | 406      | Invalid or missing parameter | The value of a required parameter is invalid or missing. |
